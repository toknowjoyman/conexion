the only hci you ever need to customize

## raison d'etre
To maximize value, all computers needs to be customized to personal working styles. We use 100s of software daily, barely customizing any of them. So we barely scratch the surface of the joy and productivity of computing systems. 

Conexión allows you to own your interface, speaking to all your applications, and presenting their data in a format tuned by you, for you!

It enables the user to never need to learn, or a spend time customizing the interface of every application to derive the value they want. And it comforts developers to focus on building the features of their product, instead of UI's to work for all.
